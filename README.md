# Bayesian Asians CS 109 Final Project: The Future of Music

## Files 

Our project notebook is located in the main directory of this git repository. It is named **Process-Book.ipynb**. THe **Project Code.ipynb** file contains utility functions used for file saving. 

## Libraries

In addition to the standard NumPy, Seaborn, and SciPy libraries we've been using for the problem sets, we also used time, cPickle, our own "project" library. 

We used the time library's sleep functionality in order to pull the BillBoard top 100 without getting blocked, we used cPickle to unpack the data format given to us by Echo Nest, and we used our own "project" library for processing, importing, and exporting our data.
